# Corporate API
This is a sample MuleSoft Anypoint project, which demonstrates pulling information from multiple sources: The **Healthy Canada** open API, and Twitter. The API retrieves content from both sources, using the input string, and merges them together.

## Deprecation
The project is on the verge of being deprecated, in favour of a version of the code that can run on MuleSoft **CloudHub**.

# Dependencies
The project is built to be run on the **Community Edition** of MuleSoft Anypoint, which is one of the main reasons it is being deprecated. It was built for demonstration purposes, so CE was fine at the time.

The other dependency is on the [MuleSoft Error Helper](https://github.com/davhunter/deloitte_mulesoft_error_helper.git) library.

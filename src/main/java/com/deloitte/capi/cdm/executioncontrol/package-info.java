/**
 * This package contains POJO objects from the Canonical Data Model for the API,
 * for objects dealing with flow control of the application. These classes are
 * used both for data collection, as well as to drive multithreaded processing,
 * allowing the API to query multiple data sources at once, and amalgamate the
 * results when all have returned.
